# Webscraping Page Web
This webscraping have the goal to fill the fields of the form and print the document in the 'carneEscolar' app.

## Technologies
I used the Puppeteer with Node.JS 

## How it works
The webscraping works with Node.JS, importing the Puppeteer. 
In the file (index.js), I imported the list in JSON format to use in the scraping. 
And then, I used two loops to filled in the program, and execute the CarneEscolar App to print the document.
